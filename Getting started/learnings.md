## Making this toolkit 

We created this website in 2023 as part of a R&D cycle on supporting national ecosystems of innovation. The rationale for doing so is explained in the [About page](../.../about.md). The timeline is as follows: 

* In April, the Accelerator Labs' global team assembled a small curation task force of four people. We, the curation force, met physically in New York for a one-week production sprint and put together a lo-fi prototype, in the form of a hierarchy of folders on UNDP's OneDrive facility, which contained 8 tools. As the week came to a close, we presented the prototype to our team leader and colleagues and gathered early feedback. 
* In May, we gathered 5 more tools and migrated the prototype to a website. 
* In June, we started a phase of socialization and sharing of the prototype. We organized a number of presentations to various teams and bureaus of UNDP, as well as to the broader Accelerator Labs network. In parallel, we continued to improve the website. 
* As a consequence of one of these presentations, we are asked to join a new initiative, at the time (in June) still being discussed with the Executive Office of the Secretary General.
* In July, the proposal was approved. The initiative is called FutureGov facility ([pre-launch home page](https://www.un.org/en/conferences/SDGSummit2023/SDG-Action-Weekend/futuregov)). It is led by UNDP, and specifically by the Governance team of the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, the Accelerator Labs and the Chief Digital Office; UNDESA is also a participant. In September, it was officially launched at the SDG summit.
* Meanwhile, we kept improving the website, with a 
* After launch, we proceeded to joint resource mobilization with the other entities involved.

Overall, we observed a satisfyingly fast turnaround. The added value of curating the most actionable learnings of the Accelerator Labs network around national innovation ecosystems was fairly easy to communicate. 

## Lessons learned

* The choice of a very simple website hit a sweet spot, which we might dub "a mid-fi prototype". It was simple to do technically (see below), and, while very basic visually (so, not hi-fi), it still was far better than a hierarchy of folder or a PDF (lo-fi). Our colleagues in the Regional Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean asked us to provide them with a whitelabel version of our website for their own use.
* We chose to roll out the website with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for decentralized collaboration. This turned out to be a great choice, because it involved only a minimal time commitment by the team's developer. Once the site was setup, anybody in the curation task force could easily edit and add pages, with little or no knowledge about website development. We find this solution empowering and resilient (since the bottleneck of the developer is removed for basic updates, which means most updates). 
* Open sourcing our content helps with spreading the toolkit. Possible partners can be simply given a live link, and have the opportunity to get an idea of what is going on. Problems remain: the IPR status of internal UNDP documents (like terms of reference or slide decks) are ambiguous. We decided to keep those documents (resources) on UNDP servers, which means that website visitors are asked for UNDP corporate login if they click on those links. 
* We could achieve additional speed by sharing the toolkit while we were still building it. It turns out that, if supported by a robust narrative, a sketchy toolkit was good enough for sharing and socializing.
