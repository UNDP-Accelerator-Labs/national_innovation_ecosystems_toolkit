## A course on Ethics and Integrity in public services to embed innovation Practices and Methods through the Ethics and Integrity Champions (Namibia)

**What it does.** Helps embedding into government the practice of social innovation through functional service areas such as HR, Procurement, Security, Finance, Public Relations and Ethics / Integrity Officers.

**Value proposition for the government or other partner.** By finding alternative structures within government to introduce innovation methods and tools in solving problems for them and practicing how the innovation tools and methods are used, we will enable the public service to use various tools and techniques such as behavioral insights, design thinking, citizen assemblies, legislative theatres, sentiment analysis and other innovation practices to come up with new ways of improving public service delivery. Additional value: by leveraging UNDP and UNDESA resources, implementing parties won't need to go through a Request for Proposals, thus speeding ep implementation.

**Why and when to use it**. Use this example when you aim to socialize to the use of innovation methods any category of civil servants, even if they don't work in innovation units.

**Known issues and troubleshooting**. Unknown.

**Context**. Previously to this project, UNDP Namibia Accelerator Lab had developed a toolkit aimed at the 300 innovation champions within the Namibian government. Sadly, the innovation champions failed to adopt the practices documented in the toolkit in their everyday work. When the government's Ethics and Integrity Division asked UNDP for an international consultant to train their 350 Integrity Champions in Ethics and Professionalism, the Lab contacted UNDESA and requested, and obtained, access to their Ethics Course and the permission to contextualize the material, inserting innovation methods therein. After receiving training, the participants had to complete an on-line ethics test and sign an integrity pledge which committed them to carry out certain actions over a period of 90 days.

**Cost to implement** (in USD). About USD 12,000.

**Time** (in calendar time): Approximately 6 months to a year to implement.

**People** (team numerosity): Accelerator Lab + 2 key technical Ethics and Integrity staff from the Office of the Prime Minister

**Focal point**. Yrika Maritz

**Country and year**. Namibia 2022
